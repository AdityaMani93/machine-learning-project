# Following Actions  Performed in :
## PROJECT : Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing

*I check in Data found many columns have zero variance then remove those variables.

*I Check both Test & Train Data for null values and found there is no NAN values.


*I check all the data any found there are many columns are in object data type, so for them to convert them in numerical dtype I Apply label encoder.


*As in Data there are high amount of columns so as per project objectives, I Perform dimensionality reduction.

*Than last Predict your test_df values using XGBoost.
